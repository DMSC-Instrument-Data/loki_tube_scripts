# LOKI Data Reduction Test Script
This script was produced largely using the deprecated ISIS SANS Interface in Mantid. Data in [loki_tube_scripts/test/test_data](https://github.com/ess-dmsc-dram/loki_tube_scripts/tree/master/test/test_data) was 
collected on the LARMOUR beamline at the ISIS facility using two LOKI prototype tube modules developed by the ISIS detector group.
The script test makes use of the data. The best way to run this script is to follow the example in [loki_tube_scripts/test/FullDataReductionScriptTest.py](https://github.com/ess-dmsc-dram/loki_tube_scripts/blob/master/test/FullDataReductionScriptTest.py)
